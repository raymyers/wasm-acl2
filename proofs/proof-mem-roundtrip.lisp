;; WASM 1.0 ACL2 Formalization — Memory Roundtrip Proofs
;;
;; Theorems proved:
;;   1. le-bytes-roundtrip: LE byte encoding is lossless for u32
;;   2. nth-update-nth-same/diff: update-nth accessor lemmas
;;   3. mem-read-write-4: reading 4 bytes after writing returns written bytes
;;   4. i32-store-load-semantic-roundtrip: store then load = identity
;;
;; Key technique: encapsulate scopes arithmetic-5 to avoid theory pollution.
